            I am Tiange Zhou and this is my third year at Drexel. I am majoring in Marketing and minoring in Interative Digital Media. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is my first year as an IDM student. I have interest in learing IDM knowledge and skills. Even though I have no experience in programming and coding, the increase of my knowledge of different fields during my college life made me interested in coding.

            I come from China, and Beijing is my hometown. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Beijing is a beautiful city and it has changed so much that I almost didn't know the city I grew up in when I went back to Beijing several years ago. But for now, I haven't been home for three years, I cannot imagine how much Beijing has changed.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>    
            I am looking forward to returning to Beijing after my graduation to see how my hometown will looks like.

        The reason why I came to the United States is that I took a trip to Hong Kong in the winter vacation of my freshman year in high school in China.In Hong Kong, I was impressed by The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        After I came back to Beijing, I told my parents that I wanted to go to Hong Kong to study at a university in the future. Then my parents said, since I want to leave home to study, why not go to a more diversified country? Therefore, I went abroad to the United States in high school, even though I strongly resisted going abroad in junior high school. This is really funny whenever I think about it.

        I feel that I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I like video games, anime, musical and so on. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For books, I perfer to read detective novel and fiction of an alternative reality world view. After reading, I like to write down my feeling about this book on my social media. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>  
        For music, I will be more attracted by the melody than the lyrics, so I'm open to any good music in any language. 
    </p>  
    <br>
    <p>
        For traveling, I have been to different places in China, Japan and America, I will choose to visit different places in my holiday within the reasonable range of money. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I also like to record my life, I record all the interesting things in my notebook and decorate them with washi tape or I will just draw on my notebook. Maybe I can call it scrapbook or journal, it is hard to use a specific word to describe. I like to document my life on social media as well. I have thousands of my boring little thoughts on my social media and it's not an exaggeration. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In fact, I didn't know I had so many hobbies if I didn't have to introduce myself. It's interesting.
